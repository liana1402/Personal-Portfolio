                </div>
                <p>I self-taught myself HTML, along with CSS, through workshops and online courses. It was the beginning of my coding journey. I continued improving on it in my first year of Uni, WebDev module. Now, I use this skill to create websites for fun and as proper projects, like this website. I've kept clean and neat HTML code and do not overcomplicate it with too many unnecessary tags, mainly divs, as well as use clear naming conventions.

                </div>
                <p>I learned CSS simultaneously with HTML through courses and improved on it in my WebDev module in Uni. I enjoy doing small website projects to practice designs and find new and better ways of using CSS properties to display my vision. I like experimenting with different colours, shapes, and fonts to create eye-catching designs.

                </div>
                <p>I started properly learning JS in my first year of Uni, WebDev module; I have briefly used it while learning HTML and CSS. I am still improving on my JS skills in making my code efficient and understanding different ways of applying it. I currently use it for user-interaction on my websites; such as altering the CSS of HTML elements depending on screen size, adding movement to elements while the user scrolls, performing an action when the user clicks something, etc.

                </div>
                <p>I started learning PHP in my first year of Uni, WebDev module. I use PHP to connect the user-interactions and data in a website to a database. I have created search bars and information pages that communicate with a live database.

                <p>I started properly learning C# in my first year of Uni, Programming module. Previous to Uni, I have taken Harvard's CS50 which prepared me for the mindset of coding in C#. I really enjoy object-oriented programming because of the planning required to smoothly produce an application; thinking about the classes you need, and how to use each member, or what functions to use and when, as well as using approprate naming conventions. I currently have experience with console and WinForms applications.

                </div>
                <p>I started learning SQL and managing databases in my firt year of Uni, databases and systems modelling module. I have experience on working with databases in mySQL and SQLite. I've learned to use XAMPP servers to host mySQL databases and use PHP to connect it to websites. I've also learned to connect a database, both mySQL and SQLite, to a C# program. I feel confident working with managing and altering a database, as well as using other SQL functions to obtain specific data or use calculations.

                <p>I've had years of experience in microsoft office applications, especially in Word, Power Point, and Excel. All of my project reports during my diploma programme were done through office applications. However, I use Excel the most for personal sheets as well. I use Excel to plan my schedules for projects, for personal financial tracking, and for charts. I have participated in microsoft Excel workshops to be more efficient with its functions, more features, and shortcuts.

                <p>I started using GitHub before Uni, however, I started adding my projects in my first year to be able to showcase my progress and be able to host my websites through GitHub, this website for example. I've learned a lot about uploading projects, using GitHub pages, changing the domain and being part of a shared group GitHub repository. The group project repository has taught me to be causious of code clashes and being descriptive with naming my commits.

                <p>I am organised both as a person and in my code. I always plan out my projects and keep track of my progress, mostly on Excel. I always have a place to take notes easily so I don't forget any thoughts on improvement or questions I have for my lecturers. Physically, I like keeping a clean and neat surrounding as it keeps me productive. In terms of my code, I would call it organised because of my clear naming conventions, efficient grouping technique(such as for classes), and commenting.

                </div>
                <p>I've displayed teamworking skills mainly through group projects and as a student ambassador. In my first year of Uni, we had a group project to create an EER calculator website. We were a group of 6 people and decided to distribute our work equally but support each other in any areas needed. Supporting each other and hearing everyones ideas is, in my opinion, the biggest way of showing teamworking. A specific example from this is that we needed to write a legal overview of our project, and the allocated team member was not able to complete it with the work load. So me and two other members decided to jump in and help complete it on time for submittion. projects i used this in:

                </div>
                <p>My communication skills are practiced mainly through presenting my projects or ideas and updating tutors/lecturers or clients on my progress. In my first year of Uni, it was very important for me to show the progress of my work on the recipe manager every week or two to ask questions and for ways of improving. A specific example would also be for our group project, we were scheduled to present the most recent product to the client. We did not fully prepare or have a specific script, however, I took on the role of presenting the website and all its functions. I successfully showcased our product smoothly and with a consistent flow through each page.

                </div>
                <p>I have shown leadership skills in prioritising my teammates' abilities and ideas. It is important for me to me a motivation to others and keep a positive attitude in difficult situations, as well as using problem solving skills to come up with the most efficient solutions. The most recent example is as a student ambassador, one of my tasks is to carry out campus tours. As a tour leader, I am in charge of talking about my experience, answering questions, providing an entertaining, memorable and imformative tour, and most importantly, ensuring the safety of everyone.

                </div>
                <p>Planning is one of my strongest skills, both in doing projects and daily tasks. Before I start any project, I write down the structure of my code and draw the design on paper instead of deciding as I code. For websites, I sketch out the designs and  wireframes digitally for easy adjustment. I have provided some examples of my planning for some projects in the projects page.

                </div>
                <p>I have a lot of experience being reflective academically and personally. While studying for my diploma in the IB programme and currently while doing my degree, one of the most important criterias we are assessed on is the reflection. It is one of my strongest areas because I've learned to be honest with myself. I look at my strengths, weaknesses and ways of improving personally as well as with my code. After evaluating my work on the budget tracker and eer-calculcator, I've learned my strengths are my positive attitude, working with feedback, being organised, and my presentation skills, and one of my shortcomings was not knowing my abilities/limits, therefore spending more time trying to learn too many new things at once.
