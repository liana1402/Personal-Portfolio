                        <h1 class="title">Diploma in the IB programme <span class="title-date">2020 - 2022</span></h1>
                        <p>I studied for my diploma in Fairview International School, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. My HL (high-level) classes were <span class="color-light-red">Maths</span>, <span class="color-light-red">Physics</span>, and <span class="color-light-red">Business</span>. My SL (standard-level) classes were <span class="color-light-red">Chemistry</span>, <span class="color-light-red">English</span>, and <span class="color-light-red">Mandarin</span>. To pass and recieve my IB diploma, I completed a project for every class called an <span class="color-light-red">IA</span> (internal assessment), one big project in the subject of my choice, which was Maths, called an <span class="color-light-red">EE</span> (external assessment), and an exam that consisted of at least 2 papers for each subject.
                        <br><br>This was one of the more difficult parts of my journey because I was not in Malaysia for my first year of IBDP, due to Covid. I was in Tbilisi, Georgia. I joined online classes for that year with a 5 hour time difference. Waking up at 2AM to join classes and write my first year exams was a big physical and mental obstacle. I managed to push through and achieve one of the toughest accomplishments of recieving an IB Diploma.</p>

                        <p>After graduating IBDP, I spent a year before going to University to work on my computing skills because my school did not offer classes in thaat field. I took <span class="color-light-red">online courses</span> on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to start my <span class="color-light-red">self-learning</span> journey in website development from scratch. I started creating websites for fun and to improve on my skills. I then took Harvard's <span class="color-light-red">CS50</span> as a recommendation from some people I knew studying computer science. It helped me realise I have a great <span class="color-light-red">passion for coding</span> because I can create anything. The possibilities and creativity are what keep me interested in constantly learning.</p>

                        <h1 class="title">University <span class="title-date">2023-2027</span></h1>
                        <p>I got ready to go to University in Sheffield, United Kingdom; my first time ever going to the UK. I did not have anyone in the UK and went <span class="color-light-red">solo</span>. It was a long journey from Malaysia but I was more excited to meet new people and travel to a new place to settle into. It helps that I'm a very <span class="color-light-red">social person</span>. Once I arrived and got to know the place, I met so many wonderful people and made lots of amazing memories. Along learning <span class="color-light-red">Software Engineering</span> from my courses, I learned a lot from my classmates and friends; most have worked in this field before coming to Uni and others are just as knowledgable. University for me is an <span class="color-light-red">exciting learning experience</span> because I get to do projects in something I enjoy doing while going through it with <span class="color-light-red">inspirational and friendly people</span>.
